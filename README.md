Create Easy filter using python and some research about FIR filter
Easy filter
Library:	 
Matplotlib, wave, numpy.
First, create Sine signal with frequency of 1000HZ, amplitude of 16000, sampling rate of  48000, and pack the data with hexadecimal format so it produce 16 bit audio test.wav. Later, to check the frequency of radio, we unpack it 
to readable format like binary. So we use FFT to get all the frequencies. Later we plot the diagram belowã€‚
